# Steps!

there are only 3 things in `steps`:
1. imap
2. ifilter
3. [reducer]


## inspired by
1. [zero_functional](https://github.com/zero-functional/zero-functional)
2. [itertools](https://github.com/narimiran/itertools)

## **steps** vs `zero_functional`:
steps targets the same problem as `zero_functional`, 
while being better at:
  1. extensibility
  2. using less meta programming

but there are features from `zero_functional` that is not covered yet:
  1. convert to function
  2. convert to iterator

## is it a replacement for `itertools`?
not really, you can use them both together.
`itertools` has lots of useful utilities.
